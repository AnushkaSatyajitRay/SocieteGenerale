### Question 1 
This Question has been solved using XgBoostRegressor. We had to predict the Annual Returns in the question (Regression Problem). Solution for this problem has been provided in the 1st Question Folder (Jupyter Notebook). 
Additionally train.csv and test.csv has been provided for those who want to play around with the dataset by themselves.

### Question 2
This Question again has been using XgBoostClassifier Algorithm in R. Solution for this problem has been provided within the 2nd Question Folder (R Code). We had to Classify binary variable Target. Unfortunately train.csv and test.csv can't be provided here as they exceed the maximum file size limit which is 25MB.
